Deep Research AI Agentic System
Overview
This project implements a dual-agent AI system for deep online research. It uses:

Research Agent: Crawls and collects data from the web using the Tavily API.
Answer Drafter Agent: Generates concise answers via the Groq API based on collected context.
Knowledge Graph: Builds and visualizes relationships between sources and keywords using networkx and Graphviz.
Streamlit UI: Provides an interactive interface to input queries, adjust parameters, and view results.
Features
Customizable number of search results and context size.
Automatic context trimming to respect API limits.
Downloadable answer text.
Interactive knowledge graph visualization.
Expandable raw data view with links to sources.
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher
System installation of Graphviz (for rendering graphs)
Valid API keys for:
Tavily (TAVILY_API_KEY)
Groq (GROQ_API_KEY)
Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
Install Python dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Install Graphviz on your system:
On Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install graphviz
On macOS (with Homebrew):
brew install graphviz
Configuration
Create a .env file or set environment variables directly:

export TAVILY_API_KEY="tvly-dev-..."
export GROQ_API_KEY="sk-..."
Usage
Run the Streamlit application:

streamlit run app.py
Enter your research query.
Adjust the Max results and Context size sliders.
Click Run Deep Research to view the answer, graph, and raw data.

Notes
The research agent caches results to speed up repeat queries.
Context trimming logic ensures prompts stay within API limits.
Modify MAX_CONTEXT_LENGTH default in app.py if needed.
