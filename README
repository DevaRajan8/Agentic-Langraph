### Deep Research AI Agentic System

## Overview
This project implements a dual-agent AI system for deep online research. It uses:

- **Research Agent**: Crawls and collects data from the web using the Tavily API.
- **Answer Drafter Agent**: Generates concise answers via the Groq API based on collected context.
- **Knowledge Graph**: Builds and visualizes relationships between sources and keywords using networkx and Graphviz.
- **Streamlit UI**: Provides an interactive interface to input queries, adjust parameters, and view results.

## Features
- Customizable number of search results and context size.
- Automatic context trimming to respect API limits.
- Downloadable answer text.
- Interactive knowledge graph visualization.
- Expandable raw data view with links to sources.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- System installation of Graphviz (for rendering graphs)
- Valid API keys for:
  - **Tavily** (`TAVILY_API_KEY`)
  - **Groq** (`GROQ_API_KEY`)

## Installation
